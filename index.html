        <p class="section">
            I'm a results-driven final year Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin with a 
            strong interest in UX design and Product Management. 
            I'm passionate about application development, user-interface, and visual design. 
            My entrepreneurial spirit drives creative solutions in every project I undertake, underpinned 
            by a strong work ethic. I have applied my talents to technology development, marketing, 
            and leadership roles, while excelling in problem-solving, adaptability, and teamwork.

        <p>As the lead designer for rebranding the Breakthrough Maths website, 
            I focused on creating a more sophisticated and user-friendly digital experience. 
            The primary objectives were to elevate the site's visual appeal, while ensuring 
            it retained a welcoming atmosphere for both students and parents.
            <br><br>
            I collaborated closely with the CEO to identify key content areas that were 
            essential for our target audience. My approach involved thoughtful organization 
            and prioritization of information to avoid overwhelming users. The navigation 
            bar was designed to prominently feature critical pages, whereas the footer 
            included less frequently accessed pages. This strategic layout enhanced usability 
            and ensured that essential information was readily accessible.
            <br><br>
            To maintain a cohesive visual identity, I implemented a consistent color scheme 
            and design elements across all pages. I also integrated relevant reviews 
            throughout the site, reinforcing the effectiveness of our services and building 
            trust with potential clients.

        <p>In collaboration with Qualcomm and a team of fellow students, we developed a WebGL 
            PacMan game for my Software Engineering module. I led the project as Team Leader, 
            coordinating meetings, delegating responsibilities, tracking progress, and assisting
             team members as needed.
             <br><br>
            While I focused less on design in this project, I played a key role in managing both 
            the frontend and backend teams to ensure smooth execution. Our goal was to modernize 
            the nostalgia of the classic PacMan by incorporating dynamically switchable mazes 
            without the need to level up.
            <br><br>
            This project significantly enhanced my leadership and organizational skills, 
            as I worked closely with the client, the module demonstrator, and our team to ensure 
            all requirements were met. Our efforts were recognized, and we were chosen among the 
            top 10 of 31 teams, praised for our effective team structure and overall development skills.
